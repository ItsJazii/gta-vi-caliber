# LOOP_HANDOFF — requests for the project.godot owner

Notes from a systems/physics agent for whoever owns the DO-NOT-TOUCH shared
config (`game/project.godot`). Action an item, then delete it from this file.

## Gamepad button bindings (finishes M1 "Gamepad support")

The analog half of gamepad support is done and on `main`:
- Right-stick look — `OrbitCamera._apply_stick_look` via `StickInput` (reads
  `JOY_AXIS_RIGHT_*` directly).
- Left-stick walking — `Player` via `StickInput.movement` (reads
  `JOY_AXIS_LEFT_*` directly).

Both read joypad **axes** straight from `Input`, so they need nothing in
`project.godot`. The **button** actions still resolve through the InputMap and
are keyboard-only, so a controller can't jump/sprint/interact/look-behind yet.

Please add a joypad `InputEventJoypadButton` event to each existing action
(keep the keyboard events; just append):

| action        | suggested button            | JoyButton enum            |
|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `jump`        | A / Cross                   | `JOY_BUTTON_A` (0)        |
| `sprint`      | Left stick click            | `JOY_BUTTON_LEFT_STICK` (7)|
| `interact`    | X / Square                  | `JOY_BUTTON_X` (2)        |
| `look_behind` | B / Circle                  | `JOY_BUTTON_B` (1)        |

If weapon actions exist (`fire`/`aim` from the M5 weapons work), the genre-
standard pad mapping is `aim` = `JOY_AXIS_TRIGGER_LEFT`, `fire` =
`JOY_AXIS_TRIGGER_RIGHT` (analog triggers via an axis event with a deadzone).

Once these land, the M1 "Gamepad support" box is fully satisfied except for the
"rebindable input" clause (no owner yet — needs a settings UI + InputMap
override persistence; flag if you want me to take the persistence layer).
